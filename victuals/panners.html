<h3>Panners</h3>

<p>Pancakes are very forgiving. Nothing needs to be too precise. Feel free to eyeball the inputs.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<h5>dry:</h5>
<li>3/4 to 1 c AP flour</li>
<li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 to 3/4 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>3/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
<li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
<h5>wet:</h5>
<li>3/4 c buttermilk</li>
<li>1/4 c whole milk</li>
<li>1 egg beaten</li>
<li>1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<h5>other:</h5>
<li>butter for the skillet</li>


<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Combine the wet, stirring with the dry until combined.</li>
  <li>It is ok if there are some lumps, you don't want to overmix, which can make the pancake a little chewier.</li>
  <li>If you have time, let the batter sit, sometimes I'll make it the night before, but there's no need to wait if you're hungry.</li>
  <li>Heat the skillet to approximately 50-60% heat and let it get good and hot.</li>
<li>If you sprinkle some water on the skillet, it should dance and sizzle for a second or two before evaporating. If it evaporates right away, it's too hot. 
Butter the skillet, then ladle on a scoop of batter.</li>
<li>It's ready to flip when you can see the edges start to round and if you lift up an edge, you can see a slight toasty ring forming on the bottom edge. There should also be some bubbles forming on the top of the uncooked side. This is about 2-3 minutes, depending on how hot the skillet is and how big the pancake was poured. </li>
<li>Flip and cook roughly the same time for the other side. The second side usually does not get as good of coloring as the first.</li>
</ol>
